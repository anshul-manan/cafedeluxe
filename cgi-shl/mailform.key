Thank you for registering MailForm! This message contains the code you need to unlock your copy of MailForm. It will remove the 'blurb' on the bottom of email it sends, and the reminder notice on the page it serves back to the user. It also allows you to configure your own footer message for email it sends.

Your User Name is : Eric Delente
Your User Code is : 1844367511

MailForm uses a web-based system for registration. Please go to http://www.lss.com.au/lss/windows/mf/mf_reg.htm to complete the registration procedure.

Remember, you must enter your user name and code exactly as they appear above.

The current version of MailForm is v1.9. If you are using an older version, we suggest you download the latest version from now from ftp://ftp.lss.com.au/mailform.zip - if you are using a version older than v1.7, you MUST download the latest version before you can enter your registration code.

MailForm v1.9 supports an alternative to the registration system described above. You can save the contents of this email message to a text file called "mailform.key", and place this text file in the cgi-bin directory along with the MailForm program. Please feel free to use whichever registration method is easiest for you.

Please email jpotter@lss.com.au if you have any problems or questions, and make sure that you check out the web site at http://www.lss.com.au if you haven't already!

Thank you again for your support!
